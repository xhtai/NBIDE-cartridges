```

We analyze 108 images from the NBIDE data set, taken from NIST's ballistics research toolmark database, using the [`cartridges` package](https://github.com/xhtai/cartridges). For more details, refer to the package README.

## Code
* `readAllNBIDE.R` is used to pre-process the images (steps 1-4)
* `compareAllNBIDE.R` is used to do all pairwise comparisons within the database (step 5)
* `resultsNBIDE.R` some analysis of the results, and also computes probabilities (step 6).

* Coming soon: Code for published method (without steps 1 and 3)

## Data
* `imageData.Rdata` contains information about each image: gun make and number, and cartridge make. These data are from the metadata for the NBIDE study and can be downloaded from the NIST database.
* [108 images processed using steps 1-4](https://app.box.com/s/bsgtumz1dmo7pwrhlclkdydn3i9c5gy7)

* Coming soon: 108 images processed by previously published methods (manually selecting the breechface marks, steps 2 and 4)


## Results
* `allResults.Rdata` contains results from all pairwise comparisons (11,556 in total): the correlation score, probabilities and best registration parameters.
* Some plots:

## Presentation
`Presentation_11-29.pdf` are slides presented on 11/29. Note that these results were produced using earlier code where steps 1, 4 and 5 were implemented in MATLAB. The current version has all the steps in R, and the implementations are not identical so there are slight differences in the numerical results. The overall conclusions remain the same.

The data used in the slides are available here:

* [Processed using steps 1-4](https://app.box.com/s/dguq02tjemimhcgj2gc0rdhau1cnou4d)
* [Processed data using published methods](https://app.box.com/s/o0dguefk95dy6zl3q9ypf08ksjbyl6wo)

## Write-up
Coming soon.
